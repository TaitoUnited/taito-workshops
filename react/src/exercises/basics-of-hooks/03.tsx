Basics of Hooks - Exercise 3

1. Utilize `React.useReducer` instead of `React.useState` to implement the same component as in exercise 1

TIP: You can define the whole state in one object like commonly done with Redux
TIP: Try to keep all the state related logic encapsulated inside the reducer
TIP: Typing the state and actions can be done in the following way:

const initialState = {...};

type State = typeof initialState;

type Action =
  | { type: 'some-action'; payload: string }
  | { type: 'another-action' };

const Exercise = () => {
  return <div>TODO</div>;
};

// ---------------------------- DO NOT MODIFY USAGE ----------------------------
const Usage = () => {
  return <Exercise />;
};

export default Usage;
