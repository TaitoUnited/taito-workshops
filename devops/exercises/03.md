# Exercise 3 - Kubernetes & Minikube

In this exercise we will setup Minikube for deploying containerized applications to Kubernetes locally.

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes is quite a complex topic but you don't need to know everything about it to get started.
You can check out the following resources to learn the basics of Kubernetes:

- [Kubernetes Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PziYflu8cB8)
- [Kubernetes Explained in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2zuL9MW6wc)
- [Kubernetes Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/)

Minikube on the other hand is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally.

When you are learning to use Kubernetes it wouldn't be practical to use a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or GCP to deploy your applications as that could be costly and you might end up with dangling resources.

Minikube allows you to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine so you can experiment with Kubernetes without the need for a cloud provider.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/), and [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) installed on your machine.

## Start Minikube

To get a local version of Kubernetes up and running, you can use Minikube:

```sh
minikube start
```

When you run this command, Minikube will start a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally.

All the following commands will be executed in the context of this Minikube cluster so keep it running in the background.

## Minikube Ingress Addon

To expose the services running inside the Minikube cluster to the outside world, you can enable the Ingress addon:

```sh
minikube addons enable ingress
```

This will install the Nginx Ingress Controller which is a Kubernetes resource that routes traffic to services based on the host and path specified in the Ingress resource. You will setup the ingress in the next exercise.

## Minikube Dashboard

Next you can inspect the cluster in browser-based dashboard UI by running:

```sh
minikube dashboard
```

You should **not** yet see any so called [workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) related to your application yet.
Workloads are applications running on Kubernetes, such as Deployments or Jobs, which are used to manage Pods.
A [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) represents a set of running containers on your cluster.

However, you should see the default system [components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/) that manage the so called [control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components) which responsible of the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.

Navigate to the `Cluster > Nodes > minikube` and scroll down to the `Pods` section to see all the running system Pods.

You can also see the Pods by running the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods -A
```

You should see something like the following:

```sh
NAMESPACE              NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
kube-system            etcd-minikube                               1/1     Running   0             98s
kube-system            kube-apiserver-minikube                     1/1     Running   0             98s
kube-system            kube-controller-manager-minikube            1/1     Running   0             98s
kube-system            kube-proxy-5lsh6                            1/1     Running   0             83s
kube-system            kube-scheduler-minikube                     1/1     Running   0             99s
kube-system            storage-provisioner                         1/1     Running   0             96s
```

You familiarize yourself more with the Minikube dashboard by exploring the different sections.

## Destroy Minikube

If you want to stop and delete the Minikube cluster, you can run:

```sh
minikube delete
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** We will need the Minikube cluster in the next exercise so remember to start it again if you deleted the cluster.

## Next steps

In the next exercise we will see how you can deploy a the application from previous exercises to the Minikube cluster with Terraform and Helm.
