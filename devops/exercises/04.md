# Exercise 4 - Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (e.g. servers, databases, networks, etc.) through machine-readable files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools such as the AWS Management Console, Azure Portal, or Google Cloud Console.

The benefits of IaC include:

- **Consistency**: Infrastructure is defined in code and can be version-controlled, ensuring that the same configuration is used across all environments.
- **Reproducibility**: Infrastructure can be easily replicated across different environments, reducing the risk of configuration drift.
- **Scalability**: Infrastructure can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, without manual intervention.
- **Automation**: Infrastructure can be provisioned and managed automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention.

In this exercise, we will use [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) and [Helm](https://circleci.com/blog/what-is-helm/) to define and provision infrastructure for our application running inside Minikube.

Terraform is an open-source IaC tool that enables users to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language.

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows users to define, install, and manage applications on Kubernetes.

Terraform and Helm can be used together to define and provision infrastructure for Kubernetes clusters, making it simpler to manage complex applications running on Kubernetes.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Both tools can also be used separately, eg. if you don't need to manage Kubernetes resources you can skip using Helm and only use Terraform to provision and manage any kind of cloud resources on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed on your machine.

## Initialise Terraform

To initialise Terraform, run the following command in the `/devops` directory:

```sh
terraform init
```

This will download the necessary providers and modules and initialise the Terraform state to keep track of the infrastructure changes.

## Inspect the Terraform configuration files

In the `/devops/infra` directory, you will find the main Terraform configuration file `main.tf` which is the entry point for defining the infrastructure.

It defines two providers: `helm` and `kubernetes` which are used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster in Minikube.

The provider configuration references the config file in `~/.kube/config` which is the default location for Kubernetes configuration.

We also specify that the context of the Kubernetes config is `minikube` which is the name of the Minikube cluster.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** This context should have been automatically written to your `~/.kube/config` file when you did the Minikube setup.

Finally we have a `helm_release` resource that deploys the application Helm chart located in the `devops/infra/helm` directory.

A Helm [chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) is a collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources that can be deployed together as a single application.
